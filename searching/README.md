Depth-first Search
--

- In a depth-first search, one moves as quickly as possible to the deepest nodes of the tree.

- Depth-first search uses a stack to track the nodes that it still needs to visit.

- it goes deeply into the tree and then backtracks when it reaches the leaves. Note that the tree can be an arbitrary tree––it need not be binary.

Breadth-first
--

- Breadth-first search first visits all nodes on the same level before visiting the children.

- use a Queue (first in first out) to track nodes.
